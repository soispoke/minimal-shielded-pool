# Compile the spend circuit and run a TESTBED-ONLY Groth16 setup.
#
#   tools/setup.sh              # compile + ceremony + verifier export
#
# Groth16 needs a circuit-specific trusted setup. This script runs the whole
# ceremony locally with entropy from /dev/urandom, which is fine for a testbed
# and for Sepolia demos but is NOT a production ceremony: whoever runs it
# could keep the toxic waste and forge proofs for themselves. A real
# deployment replaces phase 1 with a public powers-of-tau (e.g. the Hermez
# ceremony file) and runs a multi-party phase 2. Set PTAU=/path/to/final.ptau
# to use an externally sourced phase-1 file.
#
# Outputs (the setup works in the gitignored build/; these tracked artifacts
# are copied out of it or exported in place):
#   core/artifacts/spend.r1cs, core/artifacts/spend_js/spend.wasm   circuit
#   core/artifacts/spend_final.zkey                proving key (~8 MB)
#   core/contracts/src/Groth16Verifier.sol         committed, snarkjs-generated
#   core/artifacts/spend_vkey.json                 committed verification key
#
# The committed verifier and proof fixtures are mutually consistent.
# Re-running this script re-randomises phase 2 and replaces the proving key,
# verification key, and verifier. Run src/cli/smoke.ts afterwards, then
# update core/activation_manifest.testbed.json before treating the result as usable.
