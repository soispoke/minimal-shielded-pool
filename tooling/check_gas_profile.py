"""Check the EIP-8141 the current spec gas profile: two declared dimensions per frame.

the frozen profile derives the execution/state split at runtime, so a frame declares one number and the
state charges spill into it. the current spec makes the split explicit — each frame declares
`limits = [execution, state]`, and the two pools never lend to each other. For this pool
that is not merely a re-encoding, it changes what has to be bounded:

  * the state growth the settlement performs leaves the execution budget, so the execution
    cap can drop by exactly the state-growth charge it used to have to cover;
  * the state budget becomes a separate declared number, and on the current spec the
    transaction's maximum cost includes every declared state budget. The pool is the payer,
    so the dispatcher approves payment only when the proof's fee covers that maximum cost.
    Settlement's state budget is still pinned, because running out after approval burns notes.

The execution check adds a conservative write/call margin to the maximum
measured native case. Tree operation counts are checked over every index;
the finite VM measurements are not a formal gas proof for arbitrary forks.
