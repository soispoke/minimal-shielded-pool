/**
 * Note delivery: a secret per sender and recipient, and 48-byte notes on chain. This module holds
 * the note format, the wallet's keys and addresses, and the sender's channels; src/scan.ts finds
 * a wallet's notes on chain, and src/cli/notes.ts runs both from the command line.
 *
 * A recipient needs each note's amount and rho to spend it. The pool publishes notes and never
 * reads them (core/contracts/src/ShieldedPoolLogic.sol): settlement carries two notes, one per
 * output, and a shield carries one. A sender's first payment to a public address puts its
 * ML-KEM-768 ciphertext before the notes.
 *
 *   note = tag (16) || ChaCha20-Poly1305(value as 16 bytes) (16 + 16 tag)
 *   tag  = PRF(K, "tag", i)[:16]
 *   key  = PRF(K, "key", i)              each key seals one note, so the nonce is zero
 *   rho  = PRF64(K, "rho", i) mod r       the recipient recomputes the commitment
 *   cm   = Poseidon(2, Poseidon2(owner_pk, rho), value)
 *
 * PRF is HMAC-SHA256 and PRF64 joins two outputs into 512 bits before reducing. `i` counts the
 * notes sent under K. Reusing an index repeats the tag, the key and rho, which links two
 * payments and reveals the XOR of their amounts, so a sender reserves each index in its saved
 * state before using it. The recipient watches LOOKAHEAD indices past the last one it found,
 * so a sender keeps fewer than LOOKAHEAD payments past the last one it has seen final.
 *
 * K, the secret a sender and recipient share, comes from the recipient's public address (a
 * version byte, owner_pk and an ML-KEM-768 encapsulation key): the payment that opens the channel
 * carries its 1,088-byte ciphertext, and no other transaction does, since two carrying it would
 * be linked. Or the recipient issues K = PRF(root, "direct", n), for the next number n, to one
 * sender over a post-quantum channel; n stays within GAP of the highest number paid, which is how
 * far a scan from the seed looks. Change and shields from one's own funds use K = PRF(root,
 * "self"), and a withdrawal puts a random dummy in the payee note.
 *
 * A recipient rebuilds every incoming note, and every change note, from its seed alone. A sender
 * cannot recompute a secret it encapsulated, so after a restore it opens a new channel with each
 * recipient, and resumes its self channel with selfChannel(). Direct secrets and the self channel
 * do not depend on the deployment, so a seed is used with one pool only.
 *
 * All notes paid to one address share its spend key. A disclosure receipt for one of them
 * reveals Poseidon2(D, spend_key), which identifies every spend of that address in epoch D, so
 * src/disclosure.ts refuses such a receipt unless asked for it explicitly.
