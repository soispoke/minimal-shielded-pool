/**
 * Note delivery from the command line; src/notes.ts and src/scan.ts do the work. This module reads
 * the wallet seed, keeps the wallet's state file under a lock, and saves each direct number it
 * issues before returning its secret.
 *
 *   node src/cli/notes.ts address [--account N] [--seed-file PATH]
 *   node src/cli/notes.ts scan --config CONFIG --state PATH [--rpc URL] [--chunk N] [--account N]
 *                              [--seed-file PATH]
 *   node src/cli/notes.ts direct-secret --config CONFIG --state PATH [--number N] [--account N]
 *                                       [--seed-file PATH]
 *
 * direct-secret issues the next number and records it in the state; --number shows one already
 * issued again. Without --seed-file the seed is typed at a hidden prompt or read from standard
 * input, never taken from the command line, which other local users can read.
