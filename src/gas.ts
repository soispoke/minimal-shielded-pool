/**
 * Gas limits shared by the pool builder and its checks.
 *
 * This profile follows EIP-8250 PR 12279 (keyed-nonce first use as state gas) and EIP-8272 at
 * 824cbc0b0e (PRs 12281 and 12302): the recent root travels in a canonical VERIFY frame that
 * leads the transaction, and that frame's execution budget counts toward the public mempool's
 * verify budget.
 *
 * The activation manifest pins this file's bytes, so it imports nothing and holds only
 * constants. Gas amounts are bigint and byte lengths are number, except
 * STATE_BYTES_PER_STORAGE_SET, which only multiplies the per-byte state gas price CPSB.

// Wallet defaults for the two validation frames. The dispatcher does not pin them: a limit
// that is too low only makes the transaction invalid, and the proof fee covers whatever is
// declared, so wallets can raise them after a repricing without a new pool. The recent-root
// frame (cold access to the predeploy, two keccaks, one cold SLOAD over one 72-byte tuple)
// used 5,579. With hybrid public-input compression the proof frame uses 210,049, plus 90
// with a fourth frame and 27 when nf1 > nf2, and the heaviest spend needs a limit of
// 216,141 because each nested call keeps back 1/64 of its gas. The defaults leave about
// 2,400 and 8,850 gas of headroom, so the declared validation budget is 235,800.
