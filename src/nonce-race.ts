/**
 * The shared-sender nonce-race fixture. Notes A and C are shielded into one tree, so after both
 * inserts the pool publishes a single root R, and two independent transfers prove membership
 * against that same R:
 *
 *   transfer:   spend A -> (Bob 0.6, change 0.35), fee 0.05
 *   transfer_c: spend C -> (Dave 0.6, change 0.35), fee 0.05
 *
 * The transfers consume disjoint nullifiers, so under EIP-8250 keyed nonces they share the
 * pool's sender address without any ordering between them: both are admissible in the same
 * block, in either order. That is the property under test.
 *
 * Alice pays Bob through his public address and Carol pays Dave with a secret Dave handed her
 * out of band. Against a live pool (--rpc), the tree is first rebuilt from the pool's leaves,
 * so the fixture's root is the one the pool will hold after both shields land.
