# Two shielded spends from one pool, submitted back to back, against a MATCHA node.
#
# EIP-8250 lets the pool hold several pending spends at once: each spend's keyed nonces
# are its own nullifiers and its validation prefix reads no pool storage, so ethrex's
# structural test clears it. MATCHA (ethrex docs/matcha.md) gates that on width the pool
# earns from the gas its own spends used in finalized blocks: a fresh pool holds one
# pending spend and is refused a second until its first spend finalizes. Each finalized
# spend of about 1.6M gas buys about three more at the 3/2 charge. Both regimes, on a
# deployed pool:
#
#   phase "fresh"   two notes shielded, one root published, transfer A submitted and, with
#                   no wait, transfer C. On a pool with no earned width the simulation says
#                   C would be refused, with the charge; the wallet holds it on the ledger
#                   and sends once A mines.
#   phase "earned"  (EARNED=1) once the fresh spends are finalized, the same again with two
#                   new notes. C is admitted while A is still pending and the two usually
#                   share a block.
#
# Required: RPC_URL, DEPLOYER_PK, and a deploy_config.json from run_live_dispatcher.sh.
# Deploy with SPEND=0 to start from a pool that has never spent, so the fresh phase shows
# the refusal rather than inheriting width from the lifecycle run.
