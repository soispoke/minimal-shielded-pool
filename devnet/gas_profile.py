"""Gas limits shared by the pool builder and its checks.

This profile follows EIP-8250 PR 12279 (keyed-nonce first use as state gas) and EIP-8272 at
824cbc0b0e (PRs 12281 and 12302): the recent root travels in a canonical VERIFY frame that
leads the transaction, and that frame's execution budget counts toward the public mempool's
verify budget.

# Wallet defaults for the two validation frames. The dispatcher does not pin them: a limit
# that is too low only makes the transaction invalid, and the proof fee covers whatever is
# declared, so wallets can raise them after a repricing without a new pool. The recent-root
# frame (cold access to the predeploy, two keccaks, one cold SLOAD over one 72-byte tuple)
# used 5,579; the proof frame used at most 255,011. Both defaults keep a few thousand gas
# of headroom, so the declared validation budget is 280,800 instead of 352,800.
